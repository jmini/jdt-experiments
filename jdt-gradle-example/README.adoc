== JDT Gradle example

Usage of JDT inside a Gradle build.

Two modules (inspired by the `gradle init` task):

* `utilities` uses JDT to format java-code.
* `app` provides a main method to print some "hello-world" and uses `utilities` to format an example code snippet.

The project and its modules are built with Gradle.
