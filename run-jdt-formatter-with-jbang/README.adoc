== Run JDT formatter with JBang

This is a very simple script that illustrates how JDT can be executed from a simple link:https://jbang.dev/[JBang] script.
The code is the same as the one in the link:../java-formatter[`java-formatter`] project.

To use only dependencies from a specific eclipse release (the POM files declare open ranges version for the dependencies) a BOM file published by the link:https://jmini.github.io/ecentral/[ECentral project] is used to constraint the version.

=== Usage

Just run:

```
jbang JavaFormatter.java
```

And the code located in the corresponding class (link:JavaFormatter.java[`JavaFormatter.java`]) will be executed.
